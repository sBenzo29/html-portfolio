<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a mother of three, working as a project coordinator and learning web development as a side hustle. I have a 
  degree in creative writing and love to write, proofread, and edit. I’m working on a portfolio so that I can do freelance
   copywriting, proofreading, and editing in addition to web development. And, of course, I’m also working on a web development
    portfolio which this site will become a part of.</p>

<p>I live in Winter Park, a city outside of Orlando, FL. Though Orlando conjures up images of Disney World and Universal Studios, 
  I dislike theme parks and don’t live in the touristy area. I also don’t hang out at the beach religiously, as Orlando is landlocked. 
  I mostly work and raise my kids, who are incredible young people.</p>

<p>If you need a website built and you’re looking for someone detail-oriented who can also help write your content, give me a try! My 
  contact information is down below. </p>
